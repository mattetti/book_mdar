The internet is a scary place, but fortunately the Ruby community is very 
friendly. All these open source projects rely on the contributions from the 
community, if something needs fixing consider helping out.
 
### Websites

These are the first places to go for help. Check out the API documentation and 
see if you can find your answer there.

### IRC Channels - freenode.net

If you can't find what you were looking for in the API docs then you could join 
the respective IRC channel on FreeNode and ask your question in there, you may 
need to wait for a response. 

* [#merb](irc://irc.freenode.net/merb)
* [#datamapper](irc://irc.freenode.net/datamapper)
* [#rspec](irc://irc.freenode.net/rspec)

### Mailing Lists

The mailing lists are another good way to get help, the response time isn't as 
fast as asking in an IRC channel but it can be useful to do a search to see if 
someone else has had your problem before.

* [http://groups.google.com/group/merb/](http://groups.google.com/group/merb/)
* [http://groups.google.com/group/datamapper/](http://groups.google.com/group/datamapper/)
* [http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/)

### Bug Trackers

Your problem may or may not be a known bug. Search the bug trackers and submit 
a ticket if it's not there already (don't forget to include a description and test 
cases, or better yet: a patch!). You may find the ticket is solved in the edge 
version.
